Weekly Payment Pseudocode:

For: Wayne's payment history report

WaynesPayDateAudit()
	Needs to cycle through the reps and add up their payments as a breakdown by week and then print out these sums to a 'report' sheet.
	Will include:
		deposit_date ***the same as end_date***
		end_date     ***this is pulled from the date list***
		rep_id       ***pulled from rep id list***
		payment_amount

	Print format:
		Date         '''#enddate#'''
		rep_id
		payment_amount

	Calculations:
		payment_amount needs to reset at 0.00 for each rep and each week
		rep_id will be found from a rep_id list
