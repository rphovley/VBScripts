Get rates for Two people fixed (Bertha Dena and Ivan Valenzuela)

	Talk to Jeremy about setting up an update meeting between Chad, Scott, Jeremy, Dan, and myself

Options
	School 50 hours, work 30 hours,
	Defer school and work full-time, (I'd need the payout to be significant enough to offset the cost of delaying school.  Which would be a salary equivalent to what I'd get if I were graduated, otherwise, it doesn't make sense to defer school)
	Work full-time and part-time for some courses
	Dropout and sell solar

Address in meeting with Chad and Wayne:
	Make sure that the base pay section is nailed down


We considered in progress jobs to be jobs that had a proposal accepted as well as a kW listed from the report we receive from SunEdison
Commssions were calculated using the rates for D2D reps, managers, FSR reps and managers
Overrides were calculated using the full $75 per kW per job

Dan wants me to take notes for him if he is not at the meeting
Get Chad the requirements for the coming weeks.  What we need to develop and by when.
Take Wayne out to Lunch.  Apologize for assuming the wrong things
